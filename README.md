# Restaurant-Recommendation-System
In the past, people obtained suggestions for restaurants from friends or other conventional sources or sites. Although this method is straightforward and user-friendly, it has some severe limitations. First, the recommendations from friends or other common people are limited to those places they have visited before. Thus, the user is not able to gain information about places less visited by their friends. Besides that, there is a chance of users not liking the place recommended by their friends. Second, the information provided by the site can often be biased; thus the information provided cannot always be considered accurate. Our primary aim is to do data visualization with the help of matplotlib and Power BI and perform operations with MapReduce.The project analyzes the data of rating provided by the end users and uses the data to recommend foods and restaurants to the users. The recommendation is based on the feedback of different people on the food items. The recommendation is done on the basis of a collaborative filtering algorithm.
